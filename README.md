# Weather_Project
Imagine a clean and minimalist weather dashboard built using HTML and CSS, designed to provide users with essential weather information in a visually appealing way. The project consists of several key components:

Header Section:

At the top of the page, there's a header displaying the name of the weather dashboard.
Search Bar:

Directly below the header, there's a simple input field where users can enter the name of a city or location to retrieve weather data.
Current Weather Display:

Once a city is searched, the dashboard dynamically updates to show the current weather conditions for that location. This includes:
Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
Icon representing the current weather conditions (using weather icons or custom-designed icons).
Additional details like humidity and wind speed.

Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a straightforward and visually appealing way to check the weather forecast for any location they're interested in. It emphasizes simplicity, usability, and responsiveness, making it easy to use on any device.

Conclusion:
This HTML and CSS weather project showcases how basic web technologies can be leveraged to create a practical and aesthetically pleasing weather dashboard. It combines functional weather data retrieval with thoughtful design elements to enhance the user experience.
